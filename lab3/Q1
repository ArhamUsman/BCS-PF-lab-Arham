// Question 1
// Explain the output of this C program. Why the wrong value is being displayed in the output?

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	int a = 3000000000;
	printf("Number is %d", a);
	// 3000000000 is too large to be stored in 4 bytes, instead double should be used
	double b = 3000000000;
	printf("\nUpdated number is: %0.0lf", b);
}
