/*
1. Which loop system would be better for user input. 
Justify your answer by creating a program that takes a value and adds it to a variable and 
prints it repeatedly until the user enters a zero value.
*/

/*
A do..while loop will be the best. 
It is superior to for loop beacuse it will terminate only when 0 is input: A for loop will break if the count is completed. 
It is superior to while loop because it check condition after the input: while loop check the condition before the input
Hence, it is the best choice
