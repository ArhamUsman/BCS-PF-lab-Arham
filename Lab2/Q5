Q. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

START
Ask the user to enter a divisor
Ask the user to enter a number
Set num3 TO number%divisor
IF num3 is 0 THEN
The divisor is actually the divisor of number
ELSE 
The divisor is not the divisor of number
IF num3 is 0 THEN
SET num4 to number%2
If num4 is equal to 0 
then the number is even, 
Else it is odd
END
